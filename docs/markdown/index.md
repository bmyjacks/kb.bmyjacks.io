## What is Markdown

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup (check its name :smile:) language for creating formatted text in a plain-text editor.[^1] Created by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) in 2004, Markdown is widely used today.

[^1]: It's a little bit confusing, but you can imagine that notepad is equipped with some basic Word functions.

Although Markdown is not [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) normally[^2], it's still relatively easy for people to render the source file in their brains.

[^2]: Some editors make Markdown WYSIWYG such as [Typora](https://typora.io).
