## What is markdown

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup (check its name :smile:) language for creating formatted text in a plain-text editor.[^1] Created by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) in 2004, Markdown is widely used today.

[^1]: It's a little bit confusing, but you can imagine that Notepad is equipped with some basic Word functions.

Although markdown is not [what you see is what you get](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) normally[^2], it's still relatively easy for people to render the source file in their brains.

[^2]: Some editors make markdown WYSIWYG such as [Typora](https://typora.io).

## Why choose markdown

- It's widely used today in writing, blogging, etc.
- Compared to complex format tools in Word, markdown can let you do things in simple user-friendly lines.
- If everything fails, people can render pages in their minds from markdown sources. So cool :material-emoticon-cool:, isn't it?

## What's markdown good for

All simple documents work like making notes, writing articles, preparing presentations, even creating websites.

## Markdown editors

The best way to learn markdown is to try it in person. We recommend trying online editors as they don't need to config.
